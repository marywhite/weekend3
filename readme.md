#Weekend Assignment 3: Research an API
This project integrates the lastfm API, to access the most recent tracks listened to for a particular user. Clicking on an image will direct a user to a lastfm page that contains links, video, and information for that track. There is also an option to discover, which draws in lastfm's four tracks most similar to the current song.

Future ideas for this app include:
1. pulling in a different API, like youtube or spotify, to add relevant audio content to the page
2. generate musical compatability between two lastFM users. make some sort of visualization to illustrate the correlation. display similar artists and genres
3. generate musical compatability between your library and the current hyped tracks i.e. how mainstream r u
4. get tags associated with all artists in a user's library. create word cloud/map to display these tags in accordance with their relevance
5. retrieve top tracks from a particular region/county. Use google maps API to display tags or genres on a map of Minnesota. 
6. get the comments for all songs in your lastfm library. Maybe filter this by funny acronyms etc.
